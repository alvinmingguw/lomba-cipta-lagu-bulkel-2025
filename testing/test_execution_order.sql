-- Test file to verify correct execution order
-- Run this step by step to test the execution order

-- STEP 1: Test setup_database.sql components
-- This should work without any foreign key errors

-- Test table creation
SELECT 'Testing table creation...' as step;

-- Test data master inserts (no foreign keys)
SELECT 'Testing judges...' as step;
SELECT COUNT(*) as judge_count FROM judges;

SELECT 'Testing rubrics...' as step;
SELECT COUNT(*) as rubric_count FROM rubrics;

SELECT 'Testing keywords...' as step;
SELECT COUNT(*) as keyword_count FROM keywords;

SELECT 'Testing variants...' as step;
SELECT COUNT(*) as variant_count FROM variants;

-- STEP 2: Test that songs table is empty (before songs_data_complete.sql)
SELECT 'Testing songs table (should be empty)...' as step;
SELECT COUNT(*) as song_count FROM songs;

-- STEP 3: Test that evaluations table is empty (before evaluations_data.sql)
SELECT 'Testing evaluations table (should be empty)...' as step;
SELECT COUNT(*) as evaluation_count FROM evaluations;

-- STEP 4: Test foreign key constraints exist
SELECT 'Testing foreign key constraints...' as step;
SELECT 
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,

WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
    AND tc.table_name IN ('evaluations', 'winners')
ORDER BY tc.table_name, tc.constraint_name;

-- STEP 5: Verify expected counts after setup_database.sql
SELECT 'Expected counts after setup_database.sql:' as summary;
SELECT 
    'judges' as table_name, 
    COUNT(*) as count,
    'Expected: 7' as expected
